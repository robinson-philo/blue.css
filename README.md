# blue.css
This is a css file which works with brightspace/D2L files within modules, creating an attractive learning area for students. See the screenshot below.

A template file is attached, and when linked with blue.css can be imported right into a brightspace module.

It is a good idea to edit the link pointing to the css file in the template, unless you want your content to change when I change mine. To do so, save the css file somewhere, open the template, point to your saved css file, and save.
